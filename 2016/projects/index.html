      <h1>Building the Water-Resilient City of the Future</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Imagine H2O and Weston McBride</h5>
      <p>San Francisco has some of the purest, carbon-efficient tap water in the world. 85% of our water is delivered through almost entirely gravity fed system requiring very little fossil fuel. Since the 1930’s, this resource and system has facilitated growth and provided the lifeblood to today’s innovation economy. Now, it’s under threat. By the end of 2014, California’s reservoirs were down by 11 trillion gallons. That's 880 billion 5-minute showers. Imagine H2O is working with Code for San Francisco to create a safe future for this extraordinary resource. How can SF leverage its innovation economy to help create a resilient water supply in an uncertain world? We want to build a set of solutions that can get us achieve a significant reduction in water use, and that can keep us there. Help us think about water differently.</p>

      <h1>Open Data Showcase</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Joy Bonaguro, Chief Data Officer of the City and County of SF </h5>
      <p>The Open Data Census tracks progress on releasing open data. But who’s tracking what people are doing with open data?

Well, a bunch of folks are, but it’s all over the place. Even in San Francisco, we have a local showcase, but it’s in dire need of an overhaul. The Open Data Showcase will provide a single place to go (with an option for local implementation) to find out what people are doing with open data.

      <p>Civic problem: Housing Shortage in the Bay Area

Project plan: Write an agent based model in python. The model will demonstrate how adjusting the supply of high priced market rate housing affects the availability of low priced market rate housing.

<a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/abmread.htm">Here is more information</a> about an agent based model.

Python skills needed: make functions, classes, lists, import modules, read docs.

Goal: Make a program a user can run on his or her computer. </p>

      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Dan Ancona and Dale McGrew, We Vote USA </h5>

      <p>We Vote USA is a nonprofit volunteer-driven movement, dedicated to educating citizens and bringing social collaboration to the process of making voting decisions. We are building an open platform for citizens to create and share personal voter guides that aggregate information and opinions, across their social networks.

We are volunteer designers, engineers, thought leaders, political junkies, and good citizens. We contribute our time and passion because we feel political decisions should be made following clear-headed conversations as opposed to through epic media battles, cast in terms of good versus evil. </p>

      <h1>Who Can I Vote For?' Database</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Nick Troiano, ChangePolitics at Change.org</h5>
      <p>Every American lives in an average of 10 separate districts with elections, and has, on average, 40+ elected officials that represent them at any given time. To date, there is no place that a citizen can go to see who all their elected representatives are, or who is running for election -- even the most politically educated people in the country rarely know who their elected representatives are, nor are they actively participating in the elections that put those people into positions of power.

Using a combination of advanced engineering and crowd-sourcing, we aim to create a map of our democracy that makes it possible (and easy) for citizens to see all the people who currently represent them, along with who is running for elected office, anywhere in the United States -- and we’ll make that data available to any civic technology team who can use it.

At the National Day of Civic Hacking, we would like to assemble a smart and passionate team of developers, citizens, organizers, and researchers to help us lay the foundation for building this database of our democracy –– beginning right here in San Francisco. </p>

      <h1>SF in Progress</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Matt Castillon</h5>
      <p>The San Francisco Bay Area faces a housing crisis. In January 2010, the average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Francisco was $1,258/month. As of December 2014, that price is $3,002/month, a 139% increase over 4 years. Meanwhile, the median unadjusted income for a one-person household in San Francisco has only risen by 2.5% ($69,600 to $71,350). As a result the region is rapidly becoming unaffordable.

Housing decisions are made at a hyperlocal level, and draw heavily on citizen feedback. Because the housing policy and planning processes are opaque, and difficult to navigate, a minority of residents hold most of the decision making power. As a result, necessary housing is delayed for years or never produced.

SF in Progress is a civic engagement tool that opens the planning process to the broader public and enables a ‘silent majority’ of current and future residents that want transformative developments to occur to have a voice. It acts as a hub for housing advocates and provides education on housing policy to the public. Our initial product maps housing projects in the city’s construction pipeline. Users will be able to track these projects and their associated public hearings.</p>

      By adopting multifactor authentication (MFA), individuals can enhance the security and privacy of their online transactions. Thus, it’s imperative to help the public gain a deeper understanding of the importance of MFA, and to increase MFA adoption and the safety of online transactions.</p>

      <h1>SF Social Services OpenReferral</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> April Steed and Grayson Wright</h5>
      <p>Social service and aid organizations create and maintain many different community resource directories to serve their clients. Each organization applies similar resources and effort against a shared issue, but there is no shared knowledge, and these efforts work in isolation of each other.

Individuals seeking help are left to navigate confusing lists of resources that may or may not lead them to what they need. Social workers and other intermediaries must master multiple sources of competing information, making it hard to connect their clients to the relevant help. Community development initiatives end up paying for new research to understand the state of their community resources.

Enter Social Services Open Referral. We have partnered with the SF Adult Probation Department to free, organize, and distribute information about the city's social services for people getting out of prison. Our immediate goals are twofold: 1) improve the useability the annual printed resource guide "Guide to Getting Out and Staying Out" 2) finish an open source database, API, and web interface for this information.

      <p>27% of California's children are living in poverty. We believe that if given an easy and effective way, many Californians would act to alleviate the daily stresses of these children.

      <h1>Disaster Housing Made Simple</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Alicia Johnson, Resilience and Recovery Manager at San Francisco DEM </h5>
      <p>Finding housing for individuals and families displaced by disaster is hard work. San Francisco Emergency Management and other City Departments struggle to find open units available for those displaced by large scale fires and other emergencies every day.

To help make this process easier we want to combine open data sources which track available housing units (Zillow, DataSF sources and others) with SFDEM's API-based Situational Awareness Tool (WebEOC,) to create a board (usable by all WebEOC sister sites) to help us quickly locate possible housing opportunities able to relocate those most impacted by disaster.

      <h1>Gender Equality in Tech</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Roberta Guise and Jon Erlandson </h5>
      <p>San Francisco has emerged as a global hub for tech companies, where big name firms, numerous start-ups and non-tech firms with IT needs have created a market that’s hungry for technical talent and skilled tech workers. Yet as firms jostle for scarce talent and staffing needs grow, too few women find their place in available tech jobs. In 2014, tech women in big technology firms in the San Francisco Bay Area made up a remarkably low 16%. Clearly, the opportunity for technical women is huge. FemResources is a new nonprofit dedicated to being the go-to source where female tech talent and employers can find one another. We will match technical women with employers looking for their skills and experience, in order to bring gender balance to the tech workforce. FemResources will also be a resource and services hub for tech women at all career stages. Achieving gender equality in technology is the right thing to do. It will make our community stronger because of the diverse thinking and experiences women bring to the table. And finally, tech firms and companies with IT functions have concluded they need more tech women in their workforce.  </p>

Although most people in San Francisco want to give back in some way, it takes an extensive amount of research to find something you are passionate about AND works with your schedule. To make philanthropy successful, we need to make it simple. At Pinch, people inspiring change, we are developing an app that simplifies philanthropy and empowers people to get involved in their community, stand for the causes they believe in, give back to efforts that move them, and inspire their friends, family, peers, and coworkers to do the same. Join us in inspiring change in the world!

We need iOS/Android/Windows developers, but in line with our vision to create a world where everyone gives back in their own unique way, all talents are welcome and needed! </p>

      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Stephen Cataldo</h5>
      <p>Countless hackathons are full of good people being encouraged to simulate Silicon Valley greed instead of hacking for good. When hacks-for-good do collect nonprofit needs, these are often dropped, and rarely promoted, beyond that hackathon. We want to create (find?) and encourage data standards for hackathon-ready projects-for-good.

This weekend, we will:
1) Review all the do-good hacks and lists of projects needing volunteers already out there.
2) Work out a taxonomy.
3) Interview people from hacks-for-good to see what needs to happen for projects to work well. [Possibly example: maybe all the best nonprofit projects need a nonprofit staff member ready to be called on Saturday morning if a team takes the project.]
4) Share that taxonomy, write some blogs, and make it possible for integrators* to grab the projects from around the web and share them at hackathons.

* A couple of us want to do the integration step at a future event. </p>

Active citizens concerned for their neighbors who want to help the homeless often are afraid or untrustful.

Our pay-it-forward app will provide a platform where citizens can broadcast their good deeds to their community and collaborate on better ways of assisting the homeless in all regions of San Francisco. Our app will include a rating and nomination system for good deeds, as well as the Google Maps API for tracking which regions need the most help.

The thought is to help enlighten youth when they are at the gateway of selecting a college major AND allow existing professionals consider a career change. This could be a huge benefit to disadvantaged youth who may not know what opportunities exist and also provide those considering a career change the opportunity to pursue their real dreams, which could help certain economies.</p>
